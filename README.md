# Drowsiness-Detection

INTRODUCTION:
      Drowsiness refers to sleepiness, often in inappropriate situations . Although the state of drowsiness may only last for a few minutes, its consequences can be disastrous. The reason for entering such a state is usually attributed to fatigue, which diminishes attention and alertness levels
      
      
GOAL:
     Humans sometimes get bored or become less active due to many reasons like health issues, fatigue, unattentiveness etc. This can happen in a lot of scenerios like classrooms, lecture halls, workplaces and most crucially even for vehicle driver. So, my goal here is to create a model that can take an image as an input and detect whether a person is feeling drowsy or not. If the person looks drowsy after passing a sequence of image, it will create a voice alarm. Also, it includes to feature that can keep a track on the person's head movement.
     
     
     
     
SOLUTION:
    Used a dataset from kaggle. Used CNN algorithm to approach the problem
